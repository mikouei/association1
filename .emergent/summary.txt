**original_problem_statement:** The user wants to build a mobile application named AssocManager for managing contributions for associations.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Tech Stack:** React Native (Expo, JS only) for mobile, and Node.js + Express + Prisma + SQLite for the backend (this was a change from the initial prompt which mentioned FastAPI/Mongo).
-   **Authentication:** JWT-based. Roles are ADMIN and MEMBER. No public registration.
-   **Core Features (by Phase):**
    -   **Phase 1 (Complete):** Multi-ADMIN management, Member CRUD (add/edit/deactivate), Association Configuration (name, custom member label).
    -   **Phase 2 (Complete):** Annual/Monthly contribution tracking with a grid view, support for partial payments.
    -   **Phase 3 (In Progress):** Exceptional one-time contributions, Member Import/Export (TXT/CSV), and Contribution Statistics Export (Excel/PDF).
-   **Language/Localization:** French language UI, FCFA currency.

**User's preferred language**: French

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React Native (Expo) frontend and a Node.js/Express backend using a SQLite database via Prisma.
-   **Backend:** The entire backend has been built and tested via . This includes APIs for authentication, user/member management, admin management, yearly/monthly contributions (including partial payments), exceptional contributions, and import/export previews.
-   **Frontend:** A multi-tab application is set up.
    -   **Working:** Login, Dashboard, Admin list, and the monthly contributions grid ().
    -   **Partially Implemented/Buggy:** The Members page () has been rewritten to fix syntax errors and add forms for adding/editing members. The Settings page () was just rewritten to include UI stubs for managing years and import/export.
    -   **Not Implemented:** The Exceptional Contributions screen UI is just a placeholder. The actual file handling for import/export is not implemented.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was implementing the UI for the remaining Phase 3 features as requested by the user. It completely rewrote the  file to add the necessary UI sections for Gestion des années (Year Management) and Import / Export.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool. The agent should first restart the expo server, then take a screenshot of the Paramètres tab to verify that the newly added UI sections are displaying correctly without errors.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: Frontend UI for Phase 3 features is incomplete and was the source of user complaints. (P0)
-   Issue 2: The Reset Password feature for members has been added to the UI but is untested. (P1)
-   Issue 3: The admin logout button was fixed by adding a missing import, but this fix is untested. (P1)

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: Frontend UI for Phase 3 features is incomplete.**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent has been adding the missing UI components. It added the Exceptionnelles tab, rewrote the  page to include add/edit forms, and just overwrote the  page to add UI for year management and import/export.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Restart the Expo server to apply the changes to .
        2.  Take a screenshot of the Paramètres screen to verify the new UI for Gestion des années and Import / Export is visible and not causing crashes.
        3.  Implement the UI for the  screen, allowing creation, viewing, and recording payments for exceptional contributions.
        4.  Implement the file selection and parsing logic for member import (TXT/CSV) using .
        5.  Implement the file generation logic for contribution export (Excel/PDF) using  and .
        6.  Implement the UI for editing and deleting exceptional events, as requested by the user.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will complete the core requirements of the application as defined by the user across all three phases, making the application feature-complete for the MVP.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y (The agent has needed multiple rounds of user feedback to add the required UI).
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Finalize and test all frontend UI components.**
    -   **Where to resume:** The agent just overwrote . The immediate next step is to restart the

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   All issues mentioned by the user are currently being addressed in the Pending/In progress Issue list.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React Native, Expo, Expo Router (file-based routing), React Context for state management, Axios for API calls.
-   - **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, REST API.
-   - **Database:** SQLite with Prisma ORM.
-   - **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

**key DB schema**
-   **User:** 
-   **Member:** 
-   **AssociationConfig:** 
-   **Year:** 
-   **MonthlyPayment:** 
-   **ExceptionalContribution:** 
-   **ExceptionalPayment:** 

**changes in tech stack**
-   The entire backend was pivoted from the initial template's  to  based on the user's explicit request.

**All files of reference**
-   : Defines the entire database structure.
-   : Main entry point for the backend, wires all API routes.
-   : Defines the tab navigation for the app.
-   : Complex screen with list, search, and modal forms for member management. Recently rewritten.
-   : Central hub for settings, year management, and import/export. Recently rewritten.
-   : Screen for viewing monthly contribution payments.
-   : Placeholder screen that needs to be implemented.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user is actively involved and provides direct, specific feedback. Prioritize implementing the features the user just mentioned (Import/Export UI, Exceptional Contributions UI, Year Management UI).
-   The agent has a pattern of building a functional backend first, but then needing user feedback to build the corresponding frontend UI. The next agent should be proactive in building the UI for the existing backend APIs.
-   The project has been divided into three phases. Phases 1 and 2 are complete. The backend for Phase 3 is complete, but the frontend is the current area of focus and requires completion.
-   Cache issues with the Expo Metro bundler have occurred before. If a change doesn't appear, remember to restart expo with a cache clean ([10:34:42] Starting project at /app/frontend).

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  : User confirms to proceed with the remaining features. (DONE, IN PROGRESS)
2.  : User reports two bugs: cannot modify member password, and the admin logout button doesn't work. (DONE, agent implemented fixes but they are untested).
3.  : User confirms to proceed and provides more specific requirements for import/export (TXT, Excel, PDF) and exceptional events (modification needed). (PENDING).
4.  : User chooses the option to build all remaining UI interfaces at once. (DONE, IN PROGRESS).
5.  : User requests to start Phase 3. (DONE).
6.   (x2): User requests to start Phase 2. (DONE).
7.  : User provides a detailed list of missing frontend features after Phase 3 backend was completed. This is the main list of tasks the agent is currently working on. (PENDING).

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The frontend is partially broken/incomplete. Several key screens () are placeholders, and others (, ) have been recently rewritten and need thorough testing.
-   **Mocked:** No data is mocked; the application is connected to a live (local) backend and database.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-    (v0.18.5): For generating Excel files for export.
-    (v2.5.1): For generating PDF files for export.
-    (v3.8.2): Helper for creating tables in PDFs with jspdf.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None.
-   **Known regressions:** None identified, but recent major rewrites on the frontend carry a high risk of regression.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Role:** ADMIN
-   **Email:** 
-   **Password:** 

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent initially completed the backend for Phase 3 but did not proactively build the corresponding frontend UI, leading to user feedback pointing out the missing features. The agent is now in the process of rectifying this by building out the required interfaces for import/export, exceptional contributions, and member/year management. </analysis>
